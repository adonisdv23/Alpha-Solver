# Alpha Solver — Current State

> Docs-only; no provider/runtime claims.

## Current verified phase

**Post-#579 blind scoring packet construction posture: the blind scorer packet for the manual no-provider raw-output pilot is complete, and operator review is required before any scoring lane.**

The merged #569–#574 wave updated the repository from the post-#568 blocked Value Read state to a broader documentation-and-boundary posture. PR #576 was superseded by PR #577 and should be closed unmerged. PR #577 completes `ALPHA-SOLVER-LOCAL-OPERATOR-HARNESS-DESIGN-NOTE-001` as a docs-only Alpha-native local operator harness design note.

The current control posture is now `OPERATOR_REVIEW_REQUIRED_AFTER_VALUE_READ_BLIND_SCORING_PACKET_CONSTRUCTION_POST_579_001`: the docs-only blind scorer packet has been constructed from the preserved post-578 manual no-provider raw outputs for the selected 10 committed synthetic cases. The operator must separately authorize scoring, score lock, unblinding, and any final interpretation before those activities occur.

These are docs, gate, helper, static/research, and blocked-attempt artifacts. They do not prove provider behavior, model quality, value, readiness, benchmark success, security/privacy completion, local Ollama validation, `/v1/solve` readiness, production/public readiness, scoring outcomes, or Alpha superiority.

| #570 | Founder memo refresh | Updates narrative positioning for the post-#568 blocked state. |
| #571 | `14 - V1 Solve Exposure Gate Packet` | Records `/v1/solve` exposure as `BLOCKED`; route existence is not public readiness. |
| #572 | Local Ollama singlepath operator helper | Adds an operator helper script for the local-only lane; helper existence is not a successful run. |

## Selected next state

**`OPERATOR_REVIEW_REQUIRED_AFTER_VALUE_READ_BLIND_SCORING_PACKET_CONSTRUCTION_POST_579_001`** is the current global selected next state.

This is a review state, not a scoring or interpretation lane. It means the blinded scorer packet exists for the authorized subset, but no scoring, blind-score filling, unblinding, final interpretation, provider/local-model execution, runtime endpoint, dashboard/public API exposure, or Google Sheets mutation is authorized. The operator must separately authorize scoring before any score is filled.

This selected state authorizes no scoring, blind-score filling, unblinding, final interpretation, provider call, local model call, runtime endpoint, dashboard, public API exposure, Google Sheets mutation, benchmark claim, readiness claim, value claim, provider claim, local-model claim, security/privacy claim, or Alpha superiority claim.

## Open deferrals (see [`DEFERRAL_REGISTER.md`](DEFERRAL_REGISTER.md))

- **DEF-001** — Self Operator execution evidence: substantially advanced within local-only scope; does not prove provider/runtime readiness.
- **DEF-002** — Product security/privacy review: open; `/v1/solve` exposure remains blocked by PR #571.
- **DEF-003** — Prior Fable delta-audit custody/replacement: open.
- **DEF-004** — Audit custody/provenance: open unless repo evidence shows otherwise.

## What is blocked / not authorized

- Provider calls, hosted model calls, local model calls, token use, credential access, billing inspection, dashboard exposure, `/v1/solve` exposure, public API exposure, Pi.dev installation/execution/integration, package-install experiments, and Google Sheets mutation.
- Value experiment execution and Alpha-vs-baseline claims. PR #568 is `VALUE_READ_BLOCKED`: it generated no Alpha outputs, baseline outputs, blind scores, or measured discrimination-delta. The post-577 authorization-decision lane prepares only an authorization-decision packet and still does not authorize execution.
- Local Ollama validation claims. PR #573 records a failed-closed local timeout/backend error and no local model answer.
- Security/privacy completion, production readiness, public MVP readiness, benchmark validation/superiority, broad-user readiness, autonomous readiness, provider validation, local Ollama validation, `/v1/solve` readiness, dashboard readiness, or Alpha superiority.

## What must not be claimed

This phase does **not** support claims of value, OpenAI validation, provider validation, local Ollama validation, Pi.dev integration, runtime readiness, production readiness, public MVP readiness, security/privacy completion, DEF-002 resolved, DEF-003 resolved, benchmark validation, benchmark superiority, broad-user readiness, autonomous readiness, `/v1/solve` readiness, dashboard readiness, Google Sheets synchronization, or Alpha superiority.
