**You:**

Please run the Alpha_solver.py from the project files

**ChatGPT:**

The script failed to run because it depends on the **`jsonlines`** package, which isnâ€™t available in this environment.

You have two options:

1. **Quick fix:** I can modify `Alpha Solver.py` to remove/replace the `jsonlines` dependency (for example, by using standard JSON read/write with line breaks).
    
2. **Full install:** If you want to keep the full logging and replay functionality, youâ€™d need to install `jsonlines` in your local environment (or I can adjust the script to simulate it here).
    

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **patch the script for execution now** (minimal changes so we can run it here), or do you prefer to **keep it as-is** and run it locally after installing `jsonlines`?
