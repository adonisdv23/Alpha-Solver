# NEW-043 · Secrets Redaction in Logs & Spans

Adds a configurable redaction layer for logs and OpenTelemetry spans.
Patterns cover Authorization headers, API keys/tokens, emails and phones with
masks that preserve minimal shape. Logging filter and span helper apply
redaction before emit/export and deny-list obviously sensitive attribute keys.

Tests ensure no false negatives on fixtures, structured log support, span
attribute filtering, performance under 1 ms per call and absence of raw
prompts/secrets.
