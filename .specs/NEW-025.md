# NEW-025 Â· Audit Logging (Immutable)

Implements an append-only, hash-chained audit log with JSONL export.
Key aspects:

* **Immutability:** each entry includes `prev_hash` and `hash` forming a chain.
* **Redaction:** simple regex based redaction for emails, phone numbers and
  token/password like substrings.
* **Retention:** entries older than `retention_days` are compacted on write and
  hash chain recomputed.
* **Export:** filtered export to JSON Lines with manifest containing head/tail
  hashes and entry count.
* **Verification:** walking the chain detects the first corrupt entry.

Tests cover integrity, redaction, performance, retention and export.
