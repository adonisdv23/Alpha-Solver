# NEW-041 Â· Circuit Breakers for Adapters

Implements per-adapter circuit breakers with metrics, jittered backoff and
fallback handling. Breakers transition through `closed`, `open` and
`half_open` states and expose metrics:
- `alpha_adapter_breaker_state{adapter,state}`
- `alpha_adapter_calls_total{adapter,result}`
- `alpha_adapter_open_total{adapter}`

Adapters automatically skip calls when open, returning a structured fallback so
the router can fall back to LLM-only behavior.

Tests cover failure storms, half-open recovery, metrics, latency and log
redaction.
