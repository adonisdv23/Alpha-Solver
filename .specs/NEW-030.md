# NEW-030 · Weight-Tuning Harness

Implements a deterministic harness for tuning decision weights on labelled
scenarios.  The harness evaluates candidate weight vectors, reports before/after
metrics and outputs normalised weights.  If the best candidate fails to improve
accuracy by at least five percentage points a `no_gain` verdict is returned.

Key components:
- `service.tuning.weight_harness` – random search and CLI.
- `service.tuning.weights_normalize` – normalisation helpers.
- `service.tuning.reporters` – deterministic reporting utilities.
- tests exercising improvement, determinism, normalisation invariants and the
  no‑gain path.
