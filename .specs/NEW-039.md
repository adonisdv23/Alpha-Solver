# NEW-039: Routing Determinism Harness (CLI Wrapper)

Implements a lightweight CLI and harness to replay routing decisions multiple
times with a fixed seed and verify determinism.

## Features

- `cli.determinism` module exposing `python -m cli.determinism`.
- Runs N replays of a JSONL dataset and reports pass percentage.
- Stable hash over canonical subset of `route_explain`.
- Minimal diff output with redaction of sensitive data.
- JSON and text reports with exit codes:
  - `0` stable
  - `4` mismatch
  - `2` invalid args/file
  - `5` internal error
- Supports skipping records via `--skip-tags` and a `--fast` mode.

## Testing

`tests/test_determinism_cli.py` exercises stable and flapping datasets,
report generation, tag skipping, performance guard and output redaction.
