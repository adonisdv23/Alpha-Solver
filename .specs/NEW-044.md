# NEW-044 Â· OAuth/Secrets Scaffold

Implements a simulated OAuth token provider, secret store and middleware.
Tokens are cached with expiry awareness and jittered prefetch.  Secrets are
versioned and support rotation and rollback.  Middleware attaches bearer
tokens without leaking secrets.

This spec is fulfilled by tests in:
- `tests/test_oauth_token_provider.py`
- `tests/test_secret_store.py`
- `tests/test_oauth_integration.py`
