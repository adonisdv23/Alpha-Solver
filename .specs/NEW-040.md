# NEW-040 Â· ModelSet Registry & Switcher

Implementation adds a registry for model sets and a per-request switcher that
honours request flags, tenant defaults and global defaults. Configuration lives
in `service/config/model_sets.yaml` and must define at least two sets. Registry
validates provider, model, limits and pricing hints. Resolver chooses the model
set deterministically and records `route_explain.model_set` and
`route_explain.model_set_reason`.

Tests cover schema validation, deterministic ordering, selection priority,
cost/latency changes when switching, and fallback behaviour.
