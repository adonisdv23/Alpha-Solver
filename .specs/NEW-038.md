# NEW-038 Â· Budget Simulator CLI

Implements a tiny budget simulation engine and command line interface.  The
simulator estimates token usage, cost (USD) and latency for scenario decks,
produces JSON/CSV reports and can compare two configurations (before/after)
with a delta table.  Caps for cost, tokens and latency trigger `ok`, `warn` or
`block` verdicts.  The implementation includes pricing tables, CLI wrapper,
unit tests and documentation.
