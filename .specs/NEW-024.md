# NEW-024 Â· JWT Service-to-Service Authentication

## Summary
Adds JWT utilities and middleware to support service-to-service authentication.
Keys are loaded from `service/config/auth_keys.yaml` and selected via the `kid`
header. Only `RS256` tokens are accepted and standard time claims (`exp`, `nbf`)
are enforced with a small leeway. Middleware attaches a `principal` object to
requests and returns structured 401 errors on failure. Includes tests and
documentation.

## Testing
- `pytest -q -k jwt_auth`
