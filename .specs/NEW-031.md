# NEW-031 Prompt/Template Clarifier & Decks

Implements clarifier_v1 with a template deck covering eight common intents and
router hooks. Clarifier asks a question when confidence is below
`clarify_conf_threshold` and merges the user's response into the request.
Tests cover effectiveness, determinism, template sanity and threshold/failure
behaviour.
