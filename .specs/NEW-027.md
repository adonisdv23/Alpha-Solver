# NEW-027 · Multi-Tenant Isolation & Rate Limiting

Implements per-tenant context extraction, token-bucket rate limiting and daily
quotas. Configuration is supplied via `service/config/tenants.yaml` and can be
hot reloaded.  Tests validate isolation across three tenants, correct rate limit
and quota behaviour and ≥99% rejection of over-limit requests.
