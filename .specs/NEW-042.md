# NEW-042: Retry with Exponential Backoff & Jitter

Implements capped exponential backoff with full jitter for adapter calls.  The
policy retries only transient errors and honours idempotency flags.  Metrics and
logs expose retry attempts and sleep time while redacting payload data.
Tests cover success lift, fatal short circuit, latency bounds, idempotency
behaviour, metrics and log redaction.
