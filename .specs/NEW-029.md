# NEW-029 Â· Deterministic Replay Hardening

Implements track `RES_07` by adding deterministic recording and replay with
stable hashing and snapshot metadata.

## Components
- `service/replay/recorder.py`
- `service/replay/player.py`
- `service/replay/snapshot.py`
- Tests for stability and diffs
- `docs/REPLAY_GUIDE.md`

## Acceptance
- Replay produces identical hashes across scenarios
- Snapshot changes alter the hash and are detected
- Diff output highlights minimal changes
- CI gate via `REPLAY_CI` prevents flapping
