# Spec: NEW-045 Â· Pilot Readiness & Release v0.1

## Goal
Implement the Pilot Readiness & Release v0.1 workflow for track RES_06 with enforced automation.

## Key Requirements
- Quickstart instructions must allow a fresh clone to be operational in under ten minutes.
- Provide a smoke scenario deck and tooling that yields at least 95% pass rate and prints an Obs Card sample.
- Document a pilot readiness checklist and initial release notes for version 0.1.0.
- Implement a release script invoked by `make release` that writes the VERSION file, regenerates release notes, and creates (but does not push) annotated tag `v0.1.0` using git history since the previous tag.
- Tests must cover the Quickstart flow (health endpoints, metrics, evidence example), smoke deck pass rate, release automation idempotency, and ensure new docs do not contain secret-like tokens.
- README must reference the determinism gate and link to the Evidence Pack.

## Deliverables
- docs/README.md with Quickstart and release guidance.
- docs/PILOT_CHECKLIST.md capturing readiness steps.
- docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.md generated for v0.1.0.
- scripts/release.py implementing release automation.
- Makefile targets for smoke and release workflows.
- VERSION file pinned to `0.1.0`.
- tests/test_smoke_quickstart.py containing the required automated coverage.
